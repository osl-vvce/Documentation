# **Google Summer of Code 2019**


Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development.Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.

As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests.

In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.

**Contribution**

Mr. Shreevari S P , one of the prominent members and the student lead of Open Source Lab, contributed to the Mozilla Foundation as a part of GSoC. As a result of mentorship and constant feedback  blended with hardwork and dedication, Shreevari successfully completed the 3-month programming project. He also received a reward of 3000USD and continues to contribute to the open source.
