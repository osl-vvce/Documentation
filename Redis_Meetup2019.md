# **REDIS MEETUP**

Redis meetup was a 2-hour long meetup scheduled  by Redis labs on 18th of October 2019.
The members of Open Source Lab became a part of  this meetup and understood the benefits of using Redis platforms.  

This event replaced the event that was scheduled at Hashedin.

Redis Streams is an exciting new data structure. It is elegant and simple to use, and yet can perform a wide range of operations for collecting and distributing data streams. Most notably, it performs asynchronous data transfer between producers and consumers, supports persistence and look-up queries, and is resilient to connection loss.

In this talk, Suyog Kale of Redis Labs gave an introduction to Redis Streams and walked the participants through how to use the data structure for different scenarios such as exchanging data between microservices; ETL for use cases such as IoT, AI, social; etc.
